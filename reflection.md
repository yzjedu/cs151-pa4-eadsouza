Purpose of the PA
The purpose of this lab was to create a program that could analyze headlines from a file. The program allowed the user to load a file, count occurrences of a specific word, write filtered headlines to a new file, calculate the average length of headlines, and find the shortest and longest headlines. This lab aimed to reinforce skills in file handling, debugging, and implementing functions with clear parameters and return values.
Challenges Faced
One of the main challenges I faced was debugging the read_file function. Initially, the program could not locate the file because I hadn’t ensured it was in the same directory as the script. Adding debug statements helped me realize the issue. Another challenge was understanding how to structure the return of multiple values.
Key Takeaways
Through this lab, I gained a deeper understanding of:
1. File handling in Python, including how to open, read, and write files safely.
2. Debugging techniques, such as using print statements strategically to trace program execution.
3. The importance of clear, reusable function design with descriptive parameters and return values.
